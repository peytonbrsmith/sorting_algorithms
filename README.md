## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm

### [0. Bubble sort](./0-bubble_sort.c)
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm:

*Prototype: void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);
*You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
Write in the file 0-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

*in the best case
*in the average case
*in the worst case



### [1. Insertion sort](./1-insertion_sort_list.c)
* 



### [2. Selection sort](./2-selection_sort.c)
* 



### [3. Quick sort](./3-quick_sort.c)
* Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm
